# flask_p2p_digital_marketplace
ðŸ›’ A digital marketplace where buyers pay sellers directly via cryptocurrency

This project is meant to be a way for creators to sell directly to their customers with cryptocurrency. The website does not take a cut of any transactions and instead just hosts the digital goods, confirms that payments have been sent, and delivers the goods to the customer upon payment confirmation. 

Sellers will be responsible for uploading legal and correct content, as well as any customer service. Buyers are responsible for making payments, and will be able to report and rate listings. The website admins are only required to host the files, approve listings, and maintain the site. 

There will also be an option to donate to the website admins during every transaction, in which the donation amount will be sent to the admin's crypto address, and the website will then send the amount due to the seller once the payment has been confirmed.

### This project is currently incomplete, but will be hosted as an ebook marketplace when it is ready to go live.
